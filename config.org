#+STARTUP: overview
* What is Kudu?
Kudu Emacs is originally Joar von Arndt's own configuration for GNU Emacs that has manually been tinkered with to improve its workflow, and now be turned into a fully fledged system compromising Emacs and Guix implemetations of the tools required to form a useable operating system. The goal is to have a fully featured and easily hackable system configurable entierly with lisp, or at least with user-facing tools configurable in its dialects. We wanted to use this as a platform to learn about practical applications of lisp and the design of operating systems and to see if a lisp-system is usable enough for day-to-day computing purposes.

A lot of inspiration is taken from preëxisting GNU Emacs configurations, most notably:
- [[https://github.com/snackon/Witchmacs][Witchmacs]]
- [[https://seagle0128.github.io/.emacs.d/][Centaur Emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][N Λ N O - Emacs]]

Naturally it also incorporates aspects of other GNU/Linux distributions (Most notably GNU Guix) like:
- Declarative systems configuration
- A fully fledged installer written in Emacs Lisp
- A working GUI environment

Naturally various inspirations are taken from from other people and their documentation scattered across the Blogosphere or in the READMEs of the respective Emacs packages.

The origin for the name is the kudu, an antelope similar to that of the Gnu, the namesake of the GNU Project. Kudu is not part of the GNU Project, and it's developers are not members of GNU or the FSF. However we share a positive opinion of free software and therefore want to contribute to its mainstream adoption. 
* Configuration

** Use-package
Probably one of the most useful packages, even if not very prominent when using emacs, is use-package. It allows you to declaratively write your configuration and have the included emacs package manager download them for you, and also have configurations for packages only run when packages are loaded, similarly to ~(with-eval-after-load ...)~. The variables set here simply enable this behaviour.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (setq use-package-always-defer t
        use-package-always-ensure t)

  (use-package diminish)
#+END_SRC
** Auto-compile
Compiles elisp files to improve the speed and responsiveness of Emacs at the cost of first-time startup time. The settings in ~init.el~ makes sure that updated elisp files take priority over older, compiled files.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package auto-compile 
  :ensure t
  :config
  (auto-compile-on-load-mode 1)
  (auto-compile-on-save-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** EXWM
The Emacs X Window Manager allows you to use your entire desktop within emacs. Other windows are managed like traditional emacs buffers, and different workspaces are implemented using separate emacs frames. This is arguably the largest change to using traditional window managers and desktop environments, and it transforms emacs from simply a program that can do everything to /the/ way to interact with one's computer.

Still, Emacs can still be used without constituting the entire system. Therefore EXWM should only be loaded if no other window manager is running. That way startup time isn't wasted whenever the user wants to run Emacs in the terminal, on a computer using a desktop environment, or another window manager.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

** Minor visual elements
Visual items that are too minor to fit in their own section.
Visible bell changes the otherwise quite jarring bell sound into a visual flash on it top and bottom of the emacs frame. ~prettify-symbols-mode~ allows certain major modes to change the appearance of strings, the classic example being the greek letter lambda in lisp-modes for lambda calculus.

The beacon package shows off the location the the point whenever you move to a window or scroll a buffer so that you don't lose it.

Mode-icons replaces the major mode description in the mode-line with a relevant logo or image.

Solaire-mode makes it easy to distingush between warnings, popups and messages by tinting the background of those buffers slightly darker, as long as the current theme supports it.

** Dired
Dired is emacs' built in text-based file manager. Its however pretty rough around its edges, such as it opening each directory in a separete buffer making navigation a hassle. However certain tweaks can make it a formidable tool accessible directly within emacs. Take that n³ and midnight commander!

** Parens pairing
Most of the time when writing parentheses, brackets, and quotes we want to pair them. This significantly improves comfort since you no longer need to stretch for modifier keys to finish of the pair. And even if you do, ~electric-pair-mode~ will detect it and move the point past as if you had just entered the character.

** Golden ratio
The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio][golden ratio]] is a magically beautiful ratio that has been studied for over a thousand years. A Emacs frame, being a rectangle, forms the /golden rectangle/, and we can split windows using it depending on where out focus is. However, we may sometimes not wish for frames to be automatically resized, for example keeping a PDF-file open in a window, and so the ~C-c g~ keybind is defined to quickly toggle it.

** Yes or no
Without his setting emacs sometimes asks for confirmation via a "Yes or no" prompt, and sometimes "y or n". This is generally difficult to predict, and so this setting forces the message to always send "y or n" forms, like most programs run in a terminal.
